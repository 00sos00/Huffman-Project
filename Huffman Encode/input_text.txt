The Albona class were 
mine-warfare ships used by the Italian Regia Marina and the Royal Yugoslav Nav
y (KM). Fourteen ships were originally laid down between 1917 and 1918 f
or the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The end of World War I and the dissolution o
f Austria-Hungary left them incomplete until 1920, when three ships were finished for t
he Regia Marina. An additional five ships were co
mpleted for the KM in 1931. All the completed ships could carry 24 to 
39 naval mines. The five ships in KM service were captured by Italian forces durin
g the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and commissioned in the Regia Marina. Three of the ships were 
returned to the KM-in-exile in late 1943 until they were transferr
ed to the Yugoslav Navy in August 1945. The three surviving ships were 
stricken i
n 1962 and 1963. (This article is
